LTspice simulation on eeg4.asc
* probe on JFET output or on VN015 shows flat voltage after just more than 12 seconds (Edit Simulation Cmd to set upper time limit to 20s)
** Richard happy w this
* AC analysis simulation (linear, 10k points) on VN015 [line between C5 and R11] shows output in 6-72bD range
** Richard thinks VO610A should work [the info after the hyphen is about physical configuration, not electronic properties]
** see datasheet at https://www.vishay.com/docs/81775/vo610a.pdf
* will place VO610A downstream (to the right in .asc file) of C5 to isolate the phone's input / prevent bypass channel

breadboarding/physical
* will unsolder C5, and place one of the opto-couplers on the board
* using the VO610A-2 to avoid opening a package of opto-isolators
* on VO610 board, dot is by pin 1
* Richard discovers:
** LTspice .asc file is an approximation relative to the actual PCB due to wiring
** thinks GND is in an 'odd place', but is common
** actually, no problem: we're using a TRRS, but he's used to TRS.  Our config is CTIA/Apple = T (left), R (right), R (ground), S (mike)
* analysis:
** add battery
** stupidity tests:
*** Q: are there 9V on the mike cable? A: no (~ 0V)
** plugging straight into laptop, as Line In: Spec Anal doesn't show anything
** plugging straight into laptop, as Mike In: success [need to also run 1kHz signal on generator]
*** now using TrueRTA: thinks is detecting heartbeat OK

LTspice simulation
* https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/235530/using-spice-pspice-vishay-optocoupler-models-in-ltspice suggests LargeCollection.zip
** lib/sym/OptoElec seems best directory, but I can't see the Vishay VO610
** downloaded from https://www.vishay.com/how/design-support-tools/

my homework: 
1. update the .asc file (now eeg5-opto-isolation.asc) as per Richard's paper edits
